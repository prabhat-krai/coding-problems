Taking notes on how internet works


The basics of the technical infrastructure of the Web and the difference 
between Internet and the Web.

The number of cables required to connect all the devices is reduced by using 
Routers.

Then we can form a netword of networks by connecting routers to 
routers. 
This is coming close to form a "Internet"

We use MODEM to convert signals in a form that can be transfered on wires
we have available. 

An ISP is a company that manages some special routers that are all linked 
together and can also access other ISPs' routers.
